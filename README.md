- Tensorflow.js allows you to run machine learning models in the browser for analysis and training.
- On the mobile device, you can have access to sensor data from cameras, microphone, accelerometer, etc. while maintaining user privacy.  All the data used stays on the client side. Added user privacy is a big plus for TFJS.

- TFJS uses WebGL and GPU acceleration for computation.
